# SpaceInvadersGame
I had to keep the control center's name as "YourGameName" in order for the program to run, for some reason i was getting an error and i didn't feel like fixing it. If you want, you don't have to download the code just look through the classes i made and copy and paste what you deem necessary. 
(What you renamed SpaceInvadersGame)
